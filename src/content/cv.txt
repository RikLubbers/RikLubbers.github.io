Profile 

PhD Candidate in Global Health and Spatial Sciences, studying maternal and child health impacts of extreme weather events (floods, droughts, and compound events) in Uganda. I integrate geospatial accessibility modelling (AccessMod) with pooled Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) analyses to quantify pathways from climate shocks to care seeking and undernutrition. My work spans quantitative and qualitative methods in collaboration with partners in Uganda and Switzerland. 

Academic positions 
University Medical Center Groningen 2023 to present 
PhD Candidate Groningen, The Netherlands 
• 
Flood accessibility modelling in Kampala: developed AccessMod-based geospatial accessibility models to estimate flood disruption impacts on access to MNCH-relevant services. 

• 
Drought and care-seeking pathways: pooled DHS analyses (survey-weighted spline modelling) to quantify drought-related pathways to care seeking for childhood danger signs and undernutrition. 

• 
Qualitative fieldwork: designing and conducting interviews in Katakwi District on resilience, flood/drought exposure, and healthcare access.
